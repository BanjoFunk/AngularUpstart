# UpstartBrews
A Kombucha brewery manager - Made with Rails and Angularjs

### What does it do?

This is a project I put together while making [Upstart Kombucha](http://drinkupstart.com/). Its a basic brewery manager that tracks different readings and tests on a batch of brewing kombucha. You can rearrange fermenters, add test results and take notes on flavor and brew progress.
